## Features
- Virtual filesystem using JSON objects
- Common UNIX commands to navigate, read, and write to the filesystem
- Familiar CTRL+L and CTRL+C behavior
- Hidden easter eggs like `rm -rf`
- Aesthetic colors including a rainbow `neofetch` command

## Quick start
To build, simply clone the repository and use a host such as `http-server` to get started:
```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/Mxple/mxple.github.io
$ cd mxple.github.io
$ http-server
```

## Configuring
To add commands, create a function by the exact name of the command (must be lowercase) in `/js/commands.js` and add the function to the `FS[bin]` object (in `/js/fs.js`. The three main functions below should be able to handle all needs related to manipulating files or outputting text:
```js
// takes a path string and returns a path array ex. "/home/guest" --> ["home","guest"]
parsePath(text: string) --> array

// returns reference to object in path, return undefined if the path is invalid
getObject(path: array) --> object reference

// adds the input text as a new line (uses .innerHTML) and pushes the command prompt down
addLine(text: string, style: string) --> none
```
